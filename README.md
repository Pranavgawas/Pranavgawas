## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have worked on:
1. **Project Name**: [Vehicle Configurator](https://github.com/Pranavgawas/VehicleConfigurator)
   - Description: It is a B2B portal using Spring 6, Maven 3, Spring boot 3, REST API,
MySQL 8, JPA, JUnit 4, JWT,MicroService,Docker,Web API Core, SQL
Server, Entity Core, React Js designed for Car Leasing Company.
Rental Car Companies will purchase the cars in lot and then provide
those to their Customers.
The website is completely database driven. It provides detailed
specification about cars.
It Allows a userto:
â€“ Select car models
â€“ modify the configurable items (interior and exterior; such as body
color, seats, music system etc.)
â€“ Order customized cars
Based on the configuration an invoice is generated in PDF and emailed
to the client.
The website is developed in multiple technologies using MicroServices
and Docker.
   - Technologies Used:  Node.js Â· React.js Â· ASP.NET Web API Â· Jakarta EE
   - to use this this project docker images go to this repo and pull it then if you have docker install on your pc/laptop use "https://github.com/Pranavgawas/VehicleConfiguratorJavaDocker" command docker-compose up
   
2. **Project Name**: [Pneumatic Sheet Metal Cutting Machine](https://github.com/Pranavgawas/pro)
   - Description: Designed and constructed a pneumatic sheet metal shearing machine
capable of cutting .5mm to 1mm thick sheets very easily.
he project involved setting up an air compressor, conditioning the
airthrough a manifold and FRL unit, and providing a separate supply to the
machine for independent operation.
The machine utilized a Direction Control Valve to control the movement of
a pneumatic double-acting cylinder, which was connected to a shearing
blade through a connecting rod. The shearing blade, mounted on a base
frame, generated enough force to easily cut the sheet metal.
The project successfully demonstrated the working of the machine by
activating the air compressor, controlling the piston movement, and cutting
sheet metal with precision.
   - Technologies Used: Fusion 360

Feel free to explore these projects to get an idea of my work.
